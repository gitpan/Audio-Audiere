* Windows build is a bit tricky
* On my system, giving a non-existing file will fail the tests in stream.t,
  so I am pretty sure it works ok. The problem is that I just can't hear any
  sound at all :/ (Xmms OTOH plays it just fine). I tried some MP3 or other
  file and none produeced any sound at all. Must be some Audiere problem...
  (DH reports that it plays the sound fine on win32, so this is a problem on
  my system... (getPosition() shows the position never advances...)
* Error handling is not optimal yet
* in-memory streams (and also duplicating of streams) is missing
* adding a Tone, SquareWave, WhiteNoise or PinkNoise stream will segfault upon
  adding another one of them. No idea why.
* You can only open one device at a time, due to globals. Thats on the
  TODOReallySoonNowList, though...

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
