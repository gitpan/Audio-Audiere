* Windows build does not work at all
* On my system, giving a non-existing file will fail the tests in stream.t,
  so I am pretty sure it works ok. The problem is that I just can't hear any
  sound at all :/ (Xmms OTOH plays it just fine). I tried some MP3 or other
  file and none produeced any sound at all. Must be some Audiere problem...
* Error handling is not done, invalid or non-existing files will crash it

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
