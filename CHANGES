Audio::Audiere

2004-03-15 v0.01 Tels - 21 tests (first version)
  * first working draft - all functions should be supported, except error
    handling
2004-03-17 v0.02 Tels - 27 tests (not released)
  * win32 fixes (thanx to PODMASTER)
    + added typemap entries for float and char* for Perl v5.6.x
    + relocated XS code to Audiere_perl.xs and made the lib into
      Audiere_perl.so respectively Audiere_perl.dll
    + GetVersion() needs to be audiere::GetVersion()
    + Makefile.PL fixups (that is stil suboptimal on win32)
  * added for Streams: getPosition(), setPosition(), isSeekable()
  * added Audio/Audiere/Error.pm for when creation of streams fail
  * test errors with non-existing sound files
2004-03-18 v0.03 Tels - 43 tests
  * added to Audio::Audiere:
    + createTone(), createSquareWave(), createWhiteNoise(), createPinkNoise()
  * added examples/psp
  * added $parameters to Audio::Audiere->new()
  * pass $devicename and $parameters to _open_device()
  * added error() to Audio::Audiere(), and make it return an
    Audio::Audiere::Error object upon device creation errors
  * added error.t to test device creation erorrs
2004-03-26 v0.04 Tels - 59 tests
  * theoretically you could open more than one audio device (by calling
    Audio::Audiere->new() with different device names), but a global variable
    still prevented this in v0.03. Done, works now.
  * added constants for the different supported fileformats, stream formats,
    and doc and tests
  * fixed the segfault with the tones/noise - the refactoring of the code to
    use the RefPtr objects (in combination with new() and delete()) now also
    makes the sound output on my system work - Yeah!
  * moved the doc about the methods callable on streams to Streams.pm

2004-03-28 v0.05 Tels - 97 tests
  * reorder tests in stream.t due to getPosition() varying while stream is
    already playing (thanx PODMASTER)
  * setVolume() and setPitchShift in Stream.pm default to 0, not 1 (prevented
    setting them to 0)
  * added for streams: setMute(), isMuted() - streams can now be muted (and
    remember their volume while muted!)
  * added Audio::Audiere::Stream::3D: streams with position, dampening etc.
  * added in Audio::Audiere:
    + add3DStream()
    + setListenerPosition()/getListenerPosition()
    + setListenerRotation()/getListenerRotation()
    + setMasterVolume()/getMasterVolume()
    + set3DMasterVolume()/get3DMasterVolume()
  * upon update_3D_sound(), call update on all 3D streams
  * added examples/3d.pl

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
