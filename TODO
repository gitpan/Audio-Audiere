Audio::Audiere:

* add more gracefull error handling with better error messages
* Audio/Audiere/Stream is a (needless?) hash ref and mirrors all functions
  from the XS code. I am sure this can be simplified and put entirely into
  XS, making the Perl code needless.
* let psp use command line options (and add keyboard control to set volume,
  pan, pitch etc?)
* 3D sound is not yet finished

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
