Audio::Audiere:

* add error handling (e.g. if the file to be played does not exist or is
  invalid)
* Audio/Audiere/Stream is a (needless?) hash ref and mirrors all functions
  from the XS code. I am sure this can be simplified and put entirely into
  XS, making the Perl code needless, as well as doing away with the hash
  ref (a scalar ref takes less memory and time to be created/destroyed)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
