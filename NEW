What's new in this version of Audio::Audiere:

2004-03-26 v0.04 Tels - 59 tests
  * theoretically you could open more than one audio device (by calling
    Audio::Audiere->new() with different device names), but a global variable
    still prevented this in v0.03. Done, works now.
  * added constants for the different supported fileformats, stream formats,
    and doc and tests
  * fixed the segfault with the tones/noise - the refactoring of the code to
    use the RefPtr objects (in combination with new() and delete()) now also
    makes the sound output on my system work - Yeah!

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
