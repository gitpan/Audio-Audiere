=head1 DEPENDENCIES

You need to install the Audiere sound library from L<http://audiere.sf.net>.

Then follow these steps:

* untar/ungzip the package (replace 0.02 with the version you got)

	tar -xzf Audio::Audiere-0.02.tar.gz

* Check the signature. Download my key from http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc or
  from my CPAN directory. Also install Module::Signature if you haven't alrady.
  Then do in the build directory (where you unwrapped stuff):

	cpansign --verify

* if the signature verifies OK, proceed. Otherwise NOTIFY ME IMMIDIATELY. Do
  NOT INSTALL THE PACKAGE! Your system might get compromised!

* Build the make file:

	perl Makefile.PL

* Then run the testsuite:

	make test

If there are any test failures, please notify me. Thank you!

* If all tests pass, install as root:

	su
	[enter password]
	make install
	exit

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
